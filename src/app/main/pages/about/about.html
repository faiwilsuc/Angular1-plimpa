            <p>
                Plimpa is a community marketplace connecting buyers, sellers and traders within their local vicinity. Our location-based platform allows tens of thousands to connect with others in their local area to find anything from clothes, cars, furniture or a friendly housemate.

                We understand how much of a hassle it can be - when you’re in search for a functioning used car that is within budget, only to find it is 500 miles away. The last thing you need is having to fumble through the clutter of the world wide web.

We’ll post to facebook (buyer/seller groups, brand pages), twitter, and other local classified ad platforms so you don’t have to.
